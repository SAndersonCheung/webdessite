    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>

    <p>
        HTML is the programming language that makes up the Internet; every web page is made in a set type of HTML.
        Initially released in 1993, HTML has
        undergone many different changes. The latest release of HTML is HTML5
    </p>

    <h3>How does it work?</h3>

    <p>
        HTML functions through <i>elements</i>. Each HTML element is surrounded by a set of '&lt; &gt;' tags. The tags
        tell the page that it is an element, and the element
        tells the page how to display whatever it surrounds. For example, a functional type of HTML code would be:
    </p>
    <div class="codebit">
        <code>&lt;strong&gt;<strong> This text is bold! </strong>&lt;/strong&gt;</code>
    </div>
    <p>
        The element tags surround the text that the user wishes to make bold, and the word 'strong' defines that the
        user would like the text to be made bold.
    </p>

    <p>
        Everything on a webpage will be made up of elements: some will be more complicated than others, but all are
        based on the same formula. Understanding the base
        formula is the first step to learning how to write HTML code!
    </p>

    <h3>How do I start a HTML document?</h3>

    <div class="note">
        <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> typing '&lt;!-- this --&gt;' around your text, where 'this' is your text, makes the
            text a comment!
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Every web page on the Internet must start with a <i>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</i> and must be closed by a
        <i>&lt;/html&gt;</i>. Without this, the page will not be read as a HTML web page, and
        will be unreadable code to a compiler. The part of the page that is intended to be seen must be surrounded by
        <i>&lt;body&gt;</i> tags.
    </p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Code Line</th>
            <th>Purpose</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><i>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</i></td>
            <td>This tells the compiler that the file is a HTML file.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><i>&lt;html lang="en"&gt;</i></td>
            <td> This tells the compiler that the file is a HTML file that is in English.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><i>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</i></td>
            <td> This marks the page as using charset 'utf-8', which replaced ASCII as the definition of characters on
                the Internet.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><i>&lt;title>Page Title&lt;/title&gt;</i></td>
            <td> This defines the title of the page: what appears in the tab bar when the page is open.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><i>&lt;body&gt;</i></td>
            <td> This marks the start of the 'body' - the page's actual content.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><i>&lt;h1&gt;This is a Heading&lt;/h1&gt;</i></td>
            <td> This defines a heading.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><i>&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</i></td>
            <td> This defines a paragraph.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><i>&lt;p&gt;This is another paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</i></td>
            <td> This defines a paragraph.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><i>&lt;/body&gt;</i></td>
            <td> This marks the end of the body segment.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><i>&lt;/html&gt;</i></td>
            <td> This marks the end of the HTML file.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h4>What next?</h4>

    <p>
        Now that you have the base of your HTML document, you can easily fill it with text content using &lt;h1&gt; and
        &lt;p&gt; to your heart's content. However, the page looks a bit dull. Let's make it more interesting with some
        images and hyperlinks.
    </p>

    <div class="note">
        <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> You can have headers decreasing in size from &lt;h1&gt; all the way to &lt;h6&gt;!
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="codebit">
        <code>&lt;img src="one" alt="two"&gt;</code>
    </div>

    <p>
        With images, you don't need a closing tag, as they are self-contained. Now, let's decode that codebit. The
        <i>one</i> seen folowing 'src' is where the link to the image will be. This can be a link to an image online
        (using the URL after opening the image in a new tab), or an image contained within the file structure of the
        website. The <i>two</i> following 'alt' defines the text that will appear should the image fail to load whether
        due to an error, or the user having certain permissions denied.
    </p>

    <div class="codebit">
        <code>&lt;a href="three" title="four"&gt;This text would be the link!&lt;/a&gt;</code>
    </div>

    <p>
        Links do use closing tags, and they make anything in between their tags the link, including images. The
        <i>three</i> following 'href' is the destination: where the link will take the user. The <i>four</i> following
        'title' is an additional tooltip providing more information. It will be seen when the mouse hovers over the
        link.
    </p>
