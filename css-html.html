    <h3>What is CSS?</h3>

    <p>
        CSS is the design of the Internet. Every web page's appearance is defined in CSS. There are three key ways to
        use CSS:
    </p>

    <dl>
        <li>
            <p>Inline</p>
            <p>
                <i>Inline CSS</i> applies the CSS specifications to a single element, by placing it inside of an
                element. For example, look at this line. It shows a ‘h1’ header which states, ‘this is a blue heading’.
                The ‘style=’ part is where the CSS is located.
            </p>
            <div class="codebit">
                <code>&lt;h1 style="color:blue;"&gt;This is a blue heading.&lt;/h1&gt;</code>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Internal</p>
            <p>
                <i>Internal CSS</i> is a section where the CSS is located. The designer uses the element &lt;style&gt; &
                &lt;/style&gt; to show that they are about to begin coding the CSS of the webpage, and places the CSS
                between the elements. The &lt;style&gt; element is located inside the &lt;head&gt; element.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>External</p>
            <p>
                <i>External CSS</i> is when a stylesheet is linked to the CSS page at the top of the page, within the
                &lt;head&gt; element. It is the most common way to use CSS for a webpage. The ‘href’ element would equal
                the file location of the stylesheet.
            </p>
            <div class="codebit">
                <code>
                    &lt;head&gt;<br />
                    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;<br />
                    &lt;/head&gt;
                </code>
            </div>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How do I use it?</h3>

    <p>
        In the interest of time, this tutorial will only cover external CSS stylesheets. This is the most efficient way
        to use CSS, as it allows a single document to cover the CSS for multiple HTML pages, and as such, is the method
        that will be covered.
    </p>

    <p>
        CSS is easy to understand, and hard to master. It doesn't require any opening or closing statements, like HTML,
        and it doesn't require an understanding of programming, like JavaScript. With CSS, you state the part of the
        page you wish to affect (<i>one</i>), open your brackets, state how you'd like to change it, and then close the
        brackets. It's that simple!
    </p>

    <div class="codebit">
        <code>
            one { <br />
            color:blue; <br />
            }
        </code>
    </div>

    <p>
        Of course, there are lots of ways you can change text, from borders, to background colours, and it's always
        important to remember that the 'colour' in CSS uses the American spelling. This is where CSS becomes difficult:
        managing to change multiple things without overruling one another. For example, what if I have two paragraphs of
        text, but I want one in red and one in blue? I can't just change all paragraphs, as they counterract each other.
    </p>

    <div class="codebit">
        <code>
            &lt;div id="one"&gt;<br />
            &lt;p&gt;This is text!&lt;/p&gt;<br />
            &lt;/div&gt;
        </code>
    </div>

    <p>
        The &lt;div&gt; tag allows you to select a specific portion of the copy, and have the CSS only affect that via
        the label you give it. For example, this HTML and the previously used CSS would work together to make the text
        appear blue. This is because using a div class is essentially like labelling a portion of the code, and
        referencing the label in other places.
    </p>

    <p>
        Also in the codebit is the term '<i>id="one"</i>'. The 'id' part of this is actually one of many options
        available when utilising the div tags. For good practise, you use 'id' when you are referencing a one-time
        section, however you use 'class' instead when there are multiple of that class on the website. For example, on
        this website, every codebit is under a div class called codebit. The CSS then changes how codebits look so they
        read better than if they were plaintext.
    </p>
