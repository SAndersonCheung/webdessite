    <h4>The History of HTML</h4>

    <p>
        When HTML was first created, the intention was to handle and share simple, text-based document. As the Internet
        becamse more popular and widespread, new versions were created with new features, eventually creating the HTML
        used today. Many versions of HTML have existed throughout the years. <br />
        <i>HTML 2.0</i> was released in November of 1995, and helped outline a set of standards for exactly what HTML
        could do. By standardising the language, the Internet could advance, as everyone was on the same page on how to
        develop content for the Internet. <br />
        <i>HTML 3.2</i> was released in January of 1997, and is the direct continuation to HTML 2.0, as HTML 3.0 was
        proposed, but declared too difficult to employ, and eventually the proposal draft expired. HTMLL 3.2 allowed for
        a range of new features, including the ability to have tables on a web page, and allowing text to flow around
        other objects. <br />
        <i>HTML 4.0</i> was released in April 1998, and made HTML the language it is today. It included the support for
        CSS and JavaScript, alongside a whole host of accessibility features.<br />
        <i>HTML 4.01</i> was released in December 1999, and was titled such as it was largely an update to HTML 4.0 than
        its own iteration.
    </p>

    <p>
        HTML has its issues, however. It was created just for web browsers on PCs and workstations, which ended up
        making it very forgiving to syntax errors and variations of its markup. For example, elements could be missing
        end tags, and tag names could be uppercase or lowercase. This caused problems with standardising the Internet as
        a whole, and requires a lot more processing when the packets reach the client than if syntax was stricter. In an
        effort to decrease the processing power needed, <i>XHTML</i> was created.
    </p>

    <h4>XHTML</h4>

    <p>
        To understand XHTML, we must first talk about <i>XML</i>. XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a flexible, yet
        standardised specification for markup languages. By following XML's strict, yet simple to understand rules for
        the structure of documents, the Web became more consistent. A document that follows XML's rules can be ready by
        any XML parser. Due to this, it was decided to adjust HTML to abide XML's rules.
    </p>

    <p>
        XHTML (named as a combination of HTML and XML) uses the same tags and attributes as HTML 4.01, but produces
        documents that are much more structured and consistent. Some rules that XHTML follows are:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Tags must be in lowercase.</li>
        <li>Attributes must be in name/value pairs.</li>
        <li>Tags must be opened and closed.</li>
        <li>Self-contained tags must be closed.</li>
        <li>Special characters must use correct entity values.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>HTML5</h4>

    <p>
        <i>HTML5</i> is the most recent major release of HTML, and includes XHTML. Created with the intention to reduce
        the need for browser plugins, and allow for more device independence, HTML5 replaces scripting with markup
        wherever possible. Browser plugins, like Flash, were required on many webpages to utilise media that was
        otherwise inaccessible. With the release of HTML5, however, the need for Flash plugins has been released by
        simple media tags. All major browsers support HTML5 now, allowing for this media to be accessible on devices
        other than PCs, such as mobile phones. This has allowed for a more consistent Internet, capable of being used
        the same way across a host of platforms. While particular features may vary (CSS still appears slightly
        different in multiple Internet browsers), it is now much easier to allow for cross-platform compatibility.
    </p>

    <p>
        With three types of HTML to choose from, it can be difficult to know which one you're developing for. This
        decision isn't actually that important, as long as your code is consistent, and meets the requirements of the
        language you choose. You can check online if a page meets these requirements <a
            href="http://validator.w3.org/">here</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>Structure of a Web Page</h4>

    <p>
        Web pages are only processed by the computer when they are in use. This means that overall, developers have less
        control over the final product, as it is assembled whenever it is accessed. By structuring HTML code correctly,
        it will render more consistently in browsers, and is much easier to maintain and edit, as well as easier to read
        for the user.
    </p>

    <p id="dtdexplanation">
        The <i>W3C</i> (World Wide Web Consortium) are an international group focused entirely on developing Web
        standards. Whenever a new version of HTML is released, the W3C will publish their <i>DTD</i> (Document Type
        Definitions) which detail the rules for that version of the language. This document features where tags can be
        used, where they can appear, and what attributes they can hold. You can learn more about the W3C <a
            href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/">here</a>.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        An HTML 4 document is composed of three parts:<br />
        a line containing HTML version information,<br />
        a declarative header section (delimited by the HEAD element),<br />
        a body, which contains the document's actual content. The body may be implemented by the BODY element or the
        FRAMESET element. <br />
        - from <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/global.html"><i>Introduction to the structure of an HTML
                document</i></a>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Let's start with "<i>a line containing HTML version information</i>" for our analysis of this standard. This
        starting line is a tag that encapsulates the entire document, marking it as a HTML document, and it opens by
        telling the client that is processing it exactly what kind of HTML document it is. Let's go over this line for
        HTML 4.01, XHTML, and HTML5.
    </p>

    <div class="codebit">
        <code>
            &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"&gt;<br />
            &lt;html&gt;<br />
            &lt;head&gt;<br />
            &lt;title&gt;This is a title!&lt;/title&gt;<br />
            &lt;meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;charset=utf-8"&gt;<br />
            &lt;/head&gt;<br />
            &lt;body&gt;<br />
            &lt;p&gt;This is a web page!&lt;/p&gt;<br />
            &lt;/body&gt;<br />
            &lt;/html&gt;
        </code>
    </div>

    <p>
        The long '!DOCTYPE' line is the HTML version defining line, and this line in particular defines the page as a
        web page running on HTML 4.01. The 'meta' tag in the head section of the document is equally important, as it
        defines the content on the page.
    </p>

    <div class="codebit">
        <code>
            &lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0//EN"
            "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd"&gt;<br />
            &lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;<br />
            &lt;head&gt;<br />
            &lt;title&gt;This is a title!&lt;/title&gt;<br />
            &lt;meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;charset=utf-8" /&gt;<br />
            &lt;/head&gt;<br />
            &lt;body&gt;<br />
            &lt;p&gt;This is a web page!&lt;/p&gt;<br />
            &lt;/body&gt;<br />
            &lt;/html&gt;
        </code>
    </div>

    <p>
        As you can imagine, this codebit tells the processor that the page is running on XHTML. This requires some
        additional content than the HTML 4.01 definition, as you also need to include the 'xmlns' line in the actual
        HTML tag. Additionally important: in XHTML, single tags (such as &lt;br&gt; for line breaks) must be self
        closing. This means that instead of &lt;br&gt;, they must be &lt;br /&gt;. You can see this in the 'meta' tag
        line.
    </p>

    <div class="codebit">
        <code>
            &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br />
            &lt;html&gt;<br />
            &lt;head&gt;<br />
            &lt;title&gt;This is a title!&lt;/title&gt;<br />
            &lt;meta charset=utf-8"&gt;<br />
            &lt;/head&gt;<br />
            &lt;body&gt;<br />
            &lt;p&gt;This is a web page!&lt;/p&gt;<br />
            &lt;/body&gt;<br />
            &lt;/html&gt;
        </code>
    </div>

    <p>
        This codebit is a lot simpler than the HTML 4.01 and the XHTML. This is how to define a HTML5 web page. As
        HTML5 is the standard of the Internet currently, not much definition is required, as processors will presume you
        are running HTML5 as default. Also note the simplicity of the 'meta' tag in this version as well.
    </p>

    <p>
        After you've defined the language your web page is in, you're ready to make the page itself! Let's talk about
        &lt;head&gt;! The 'head' tag encapsulates everything on the web page that the browser and processor
        loading the page need to know. This means the title that appears in the tab at the top, the language the page is
        in, and any additional information, such as a favicon. The information in the 'head' is not actually on the page
        itself.
    </p>

    <p>
        The &lt;body&gt; tag is everything that is on the web page. Titles, copy, images, tables, videos, links, if it's
        visible on the web page, it's written in the body of the HTML document. As such, this is primarily where
        developers write their code.
    </p>

    <h3 id="3parttwo">Tags & Attributes</h3>

    <p>
        A tag is how you define something on the web page. Let's imagine we're writing code for the &lt;body&gt; of a
        web page. Anything on the page will use a tag to define it. For example, if you would like the page to begin
        with a header, we begin with a &lt;h1&gt; tag. With tags that feature text, like 'h1' and 'p', you must remember
        that they work in pairs; you must close the tags that you open. Otherwise, the processor doesn't know when your
        header ends and your copy begins. Some tags however, are not paired, and are fine on their own, such as 'img'
        and 'hr'. Depending on what type on HTML your web page works on, you may have to make the tag self-closing, as
        previously mentioned. Tags can contain other tags within themselves, called nesting, allowing for thing such as
        italicised text and hyperlinks. When tags are nested, it's good practise to ensure they are indented, to make
        the code overall easier to read.
    </p>

    <p>
        While a tag defines something, an attribute is like an adjective. The attribute provides additional information
        about the tag, and can alter its behaviour. They appear as so:
    </p>

    <div class="codebit">
        <code>
            &lt;tag attribute="value"&gt;content&lt;/tag&gt;
        </code>
    </div>

    <p>
        Attributes are declared only in the opening tag, and exist in self-closing tags as well. Attributes are used,
        for example, when defining an image. An attribute would be 'src', and the value would be the source of the image
        the developer wishes to be on the page, whether this is a hyperlink, or a location within a file structure to
        retrieve the image. All attributes must have a value to work.
    </p>

    <p>
        Due to the vast number of tags supported by the most recent HTML versions, tags are categorised so they can be
        understood easier. The first, most basic form of tag is a <strong>block-level tag</strong>. These tags provide
        basic structure
        for a web page, including headers, paragraphs, lists, and tables.
    </p>

    <h4>Tag List</h4>

    <p>
        <i>Headers</i> are defined by a &lt;h1&gt; tag. The number can be replaced by any number 1 to 6, each number
        representing a slightly smaller heading. This allows for exponentially decreasing in size font for the headers.
        It is important when using headers not to skip over a number for a smaller font size, as this is considered bad
        practise. Instead, they should always start at one (with one &lt;h1&gt; tag per page), and go down a size for a
        subheading or section.
    </p>

    <p>
        Paragraphs make up the main body of the web page, as they are where the page's primary content will be located.
        Just like using a word document, there is a specific difference between a sentence starting on a new line, and
        being its own seperate paragraph. If it's the latter, simple make a new &lt;p&gt; tag and type your next
        paragraph. The former, meanwhile, is called a <i>line break</i>, and is characterised by the tag &lt;br&gt;.
        This tag is self contained, meaning it doesn't need a closing tag, and is typically located in the middle of a
        paragraph. Similar to this is a horizontal rule, which is a line that goes across the page to seperate two
        sections of the page. There's one on this page before the footer! This is a &lt;hr&gt; self-contained tag.
    </p>

    <p>
        In HTML, there are three types of list. <br />
        <i>Ordered lists</i> are lists where every value on the list begins with a number that is counting up. This is
        typically used for a set of instructions, dictating the order to follow the instructions. Attribute use allows
        developers to change the starting number of the list, or how the list counts up (to Roman numerals, etc).<br />
        <i>Unordered lists</i> use bullet points instead of numbers, and are typically used to list a number of points,
        or for structure. <br />
        <i>Definition lists</i> are lists that read like entries in a dictionary with terms and term definitions. Terms
        are bolded, whilst definitions are text that follow a term. <br />
        For ordered and unordered lists, their tags are &lt;ol&gt; and &lt;ul&gt; accordingly, with every entry on a
        list being surrounded by a &lt;li&gt; tag, for 'list item'. Definition lists are individual in this aspect, as
        they are defined by &lt;dl&gt;, but terms are defined by &lt;dt&gt;, and definitions &lt;dd&gt;.
    </p>

    <p>
        In HTML5, there are <strong>flow elements</strong>. These are tags introduced to represent more modern documents
        on the web, and
        replacing the need for extra common 'id' and 'class' attributes by making their own tags. These are typically
        tags such as &lt;article&gt;, &lt;header&gt; and &lt;footer&gt;, and &lt;menu&gt;.
    </p>

    <p>
        The next type of tag is an <strong>inline tag</strong>. These are tags that a nexted within block-level tags,
        such as within a paragraph. They include tags such as &lt;i&gt;, for italicised text, and &lt;strong&gt;, for
        bolded text. They typically apply more meaning and emphasis on the text, however, different browsers may render
        them slightly differently. <br />
        <i>Logical inline tags</i> are tags which provide semantic meaning to the content they encapsulate, such as
        &lt;code&gt;, for code fragments, and &lt;cite&gt;, for citations. Italicisation and bolding come under logical
        inline tags.<br />
        <i>Physical inline tags</i> are tags used for visual feedback. Italicisation and bolding text also comes under
        this category, but so does &lt;s&gt;, for strikethrough text, and &lt;sub&gt; and &lt;sup&gt; for making
        <sub>subscript</sub> and <sup>superscript</sup> accordingly.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once again exclusive to HTML5, <strong>phrasing elements</strong> were created for the same reasons as flow
        elements, yet cover a different area of additions, worthy of their own section. This includes often lesser-used
        features, such as &lt;progress&gt; and &lt;time&gt;, and more common features, like &lt;canvas&gt;.
    </p>

    <div class="codebit">
        <code>&lt;a href="link" title="tooltip"&gt;This text would be the link!&lt;/a&gt;</code>
    </div>

    <p>
        The codebit above is the general HTML anatomy of a hyperlink. Hyperlinks can be text or images, and can link to
        anything accessible on the Internet, or other pages within the file structure of the web page. THe 'href'
        location in quotes is the destination of the link, and the 'title' tooltip is the text that appears when the
        user hovers their mouse over the link, providing more information on the link's destination. <br />
        Not only can links go to other pages, but also to specific sections of the page the user is currently on.
        Instead of the word link, replace the code with '#section'. Then, apply an id attribute called 'section' to a
        part of your page. Clinking the link should now automatically scroll the page down to that part of the web page.
    </p>

    <p>
        Tables are used to showcase data in an easy-to-read, easy-to-understand format. To write a table in HTML, you
        read left-to-right, and then go down to the leftmost cell of the next row and repeat. Headers in tables use
        &lt;th&gt;, and entries use &lt;td&gt;, but each row of the table must be within a &lt;tr&gt; tag, and all rows
        of the table must be within a &lt;table&gt; tag. <br />
        Tables also have table-specific attributes, such as 'border' and 'width'. Every individual cell of the table can
        have its own attributes too, such as 'colspan' and 'rowspan', which allows for the usage of merged cells.<br />
        Tables can also be captioned, which allows for a title to be put on the caption. This is typically done
        immediately after the opening &lt;table&gt; tag.
    </p>

    <p>
        Imagine you want to structure your document into sections, without using a line break or a horizontal rule. How
        would you do so? The &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; tags allow you to segmentise specific parts of your web page.
        'div' is used to as a block-level tag, containing images and whole paragraphs, while span is an inline tag,
        covering small portions of text within a paragraph. Combining these tags with the 'id' and 'class' attributes
        allows developers a wide range of customisation and classification on their web page, and to impact these
        classes through CSS.
    </p>

    <p>
        XHTML requires all characters that aren't letters or numbers to be specified exactly. This can be with simple
        character entity names - &copy; can be specified as &.copy; without a full stop - or with numeric references.
        Numeric references are used for less common references, such as specially accented vowels used in foreign
        languages, or even the Greek alphabet (&#8721; is &.#8721; without a full stop). A full list of these entities
        can be found <a href="http://htmlhelp.com/reference/html40/entities/">here</a>.
    </p>

    <h3 id="3partthree">Standards & Validation</h3>

    <h4>Standards</h4>

    <p>Standards are a set of rules used to ensure that web content can be viable in the long-term. Essentially, by
        adhering to the standardised rules the W3C can ensure that HTML can support your web page for as long as
        possible, meaning that less updates are required overall. More information on W3C's standards can be found <a
            href="http://www.webstandards.org/about/mission/">here</a>. Standards were created with the help of most
        major software and hardware manufacturers, and are not, despite common belief, the sole responsibility of the
        W3C.
    </p>

    <p>
        When web technology became more mainstream, the expansion of technology and advancement often left users using
        'wrong' browsers excluded, as certain pages would load and function incorrectly. This meant users typically
        required several versions of Internet browsers to access the entirety of the Internet. By ensuring that web
        developers today maintain standards, browser developers have a much easier time of ensuring compatibility.
    </p>

    <p>
        As previously mentioned above (<a href="#dtdexplanation">here</a>), the W3C released a DTD (Document Type
        Definition) for every update to HTML, alongside recommendations of how browsers should interpret the content.
        <br />
        Every version of HTML or XHTML has at least two DTDs, which are the two main types. <i>Strict</i> DTD's contain
        only the current, valid tags and attributes, while <i>Transitional</i> also holds deprecated definitions,
        allowing for backwards compatibility. On this course, it is important to ensure you are abiding the Strict DTD,
        so your code compiles correctly. A DTD declatation is the previously explained link in the first line of HTML,
        the '!DOCTYPE' tag. This tag links the page to the DTD it is abiding, which is actually a text-file, read by the
        machine.

    <p>
        <i>Deprecated</i> tags and attributes are tags and attributes that are out of date, and no longer supported by
        the most modern form of HTML. This occured with the introduction of HTML 4.01, which encouraged developers to
        remove the deprecated tags from their code. These tags are solidly invalid for strict HTML 4.01 and strict
        XHTML, and will form errors. THe most common deprecations are style and layout focused; for example, the
        &lt;font&gt; inline tags, and the 'align' attributes. The appearance and design achieved with these deprecated
        tags and attributes can now be achieved through CSS.

    <h4>Validation</h4>

    <p>
        Validation is when a reader detects which DTD the code is abiding, and runs it against the DTD. While there are
        many tools online, the W3C has their own specific validator (<a href="http://validator.w3.org/">here</a>).
        Validators are necessary because you cannot tell through running the code alone if the code is valid; browsers
        do not validate markup.
