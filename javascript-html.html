    <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>

    <p>
        In order for webpages to appear how they do, designers and programmers use the programming languages HTML and
        CSS. These languages have been the standard for webpages for decades, and are still the standard today. However,
        in 1995, Brendan Eich created, what is today known as JavaScript.
        JavaScript works alongside HTML and CSS to allow programmers to make their webpages interactive. For example,
        JavaScript can replace images once they have been clicked on, be used to implement interactive maps directly
        onto a webpage, and implement applications.
    </p>

    <h3>Why use it?</h3>

    <p>
        JavaScript is a language used to enhance a website, and make it more appealing, or more interactive. There are
        three major uses for JavaScript on modern websites.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Navigation systems can be made purely through HTML and CSS, but many websites use JavaScript to accentuate
            them, and allow for more advanced usage of navigation. A lot of simple methods commonly used today are
            created through JavaScript, such as drop-down lists, and submenus that appear once the user hovers over the
            button. These are used to allow for a more advanced type of navigation, and allow the user to access any
            page from anywhere on the website.
        </li>

        <li>
            In order to ensure that a website is not flooded with invalid response forms, JavaScript is used as a
            validation method. When a website that you are trying to sign up for rejects your phone number due to it
            being in an incorrect syntax, it is making use of JavaScript. This stops users from submitting invalid data
            to the website, and getting locked out of making another account, and also stops the website from being
            victim to receiving a lot of invalid account data.
        </li>

        <li>
            Websites are constantly trying to stand out in their userâ€™s minds by creating attention-grabbing features
            and effects. Effects such as a scrolling message in a text Sbox, or an ever-changing image are used to make
            the page much more memorable to the user, and increase traffic.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        However, JavaScript is incapable of affecting anything outside of the website. It cannot affect files or
        local devices, affect users other than how they use the webpage (it cannot, for example, prevent users from
        saving images from their site and stealing them for personal use, or be used to hack a webcam), or line the
        webpage to a database without extensive usage of server-side scripting.
    </p>

    <p>
        A full timeline on the development and evolution of JavaScript is available <a href=timeline-html.html>here</a>.

    <h3>How do we use it?</h3>

    <p>
        Somehow.
