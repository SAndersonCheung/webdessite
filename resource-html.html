            <h3>W3Schools</h3>
            <p>For HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/"><b>W3Schools</b></a> is a website that hosts a compilation of 
                tutorials for all three web-development languages. The website is clean, simple, and easy 
                to read and understand, as well as offering 'Try It Yourself!' pages allowing the user to
                attempt writing their own code using their tutorials. As such, it is a very useful resource
                for learning these languages, and is highly recommended by professionals in every capacity.</p>

            <h3>CodeAcademy</h3>
            <p>For HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/"><b>CodeAcademy</b></a> is a less specialist website that allows
            users to go through the motions of step-by-step learning a language. This is very good if you are teaching
            yourself the language from scratch, but not-so-useful if you come from an intermediate starting point, as you
            will be required to re-learn the basics.</p>

            <h3>Learn-HTML.org</h3>
            <p>For HTML, and CSS.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.learn-html.org/"><b>Learn-HTML.ORG</b></a> is a website created specifically to aid in
                learning HTML and CSS. The main perk of this website over the previously listed websites for this is that it
                allows the user to try out code snippets without being taken to a seperate page, as it is on CodeAcademy.</p>
