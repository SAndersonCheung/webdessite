        <p>
            In order for webpages to appear how they do, designers and programmers use the programming languages HTML
            and CSS. These languages have been the standard for webpages for decades, and are still the standard today.
            However, in 1995, Brendan Eich created, what is today known as JavaScript.
            JavaScript works alongside HTML and CSS to allow programmers to make their webpages interactive. For
            example, JavaScript can replace images once they have been clicked on, be used to implement interactive maps
            directly onto a webpage, and implement applications.
        </p>

        <h3>Why use it?</h3>

        <p>
            JavaScript is a language used to enhance a website, and make it more appealing, or more interactive. There
            are three major uses for JavaScript on modern websites.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Navigation systems can be made purely through HTML and CSS, but many websites use JavaScript to
                accentuate them, and allow for more advanced usage of navigation. A lot of simple methods commonly used
                today are created through JavaScript, such as drop-down lists, and submenus that appear once the user
                hovers over the button. These are used to allow for a more advanced type of navigation, and allow the
                user to access any page from anywhere on the website.
            </li>

            <li>
                In order to ensure that a website is not flooded with invalid response forms, JavaScript is used as a
                validation method. When a website that you are trying to sign up for rejects your phone number due to it
                being in an incorrect syntax, it is making use of JavaScript. This stops users from submitting invalid
                data to the website, and getting locked out of making another account, and also stops the website from
                being victim to receiving a lot of invalid account data.
            </li>

            <li>
                Websites are constantly trying to stand out in their userâ€™s minds by creating attention-grabbing
                features and effects. Effects such as a scrolling message in a text Sbox, or an ever-changing image are
                used to make the page much more memorable to the user, and increase traffic.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            However, JavaScript is incapable of affecting anything outside of the website. It cannot affect files or
            local devices, affect users other than how they use the webpage (it cannot, for example, prevent users from
            saving images from their site and stealing them for personal use, or be used to hack a webcam), or line the
            webpage to a database without extensive usage of server-side scripting.
        </p>

                href="timeline-html.html">here</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>How do we use it?</h3>

        <p>
            Unlike the HTML and CSS sections, this JavaScript section will detail a harder part of JavaScript, rather
            than acting as an intro. Please read <a href="lecdir-five.html">this page</a> before starting the below, as
            it may be difficult to understand without the prior reading!

        <h3>Modal Images</h3>

        <p>
            Are you ever on a website that allows you to click on an image, and it places a larger version of the image
            in the centre of the screen, and dims the rest of the web page surrounding the image? This technique is used
            on a wide host of social media websites, so you've probably ran into it. This is achieved with some
            JavaScript, and is called a modal image. Try clicking on this image to see an example.
        </p>

        <img id="modalImg" src="images/modalimage.jpg" class="center" alt="An image of the sky to act as a modal image"
            style="width:15%;max-width:25%" />
        <div id="eModal" class="modal">
            <img src="images/modalimage.jpg" class="modalContent" id="img1" alt="An image of the sky to act as a modal image" />
        </div>

        <script type="text/javascript">
            var modal = document.getElementById('eModal');

            var img = document.getElementById('modalImg');
            var modalImg = document.getElementById("img1");
            img.onclick = function () {
                modal.style.display = "block";
                modalImg.src = this.src;
            }

            document.getElementsByClassName("modal")[0].onclick = function () {
                modal.style.display = "none";
            }
        </script>

        <div class="note">
            <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> Yes, you can link two external style sheets to one HTML document! The one linked
                last will take priority, as it will override anything not titled with an '!important'!
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            Let's go through how to accomplish this! It's a mash of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used external CSS for
            this, and made an independent stylesheet for this as not to mess with the website design style sheet. Let's
            take this step by step.
        </p>

        <h4>HTML</h4>

        <p>
            The HTML for a modal image is mostly a case of understanding your 'div' id's and classes, and not mixing up
            any names, as it's important to know which is what. Here's the code I used for the image above:
        </p>

        <div class="codebit">
            <code>
            (1)&lt;img id="modalImg" src="images/modalimage.jpg" alt="An image of the sky to act as a modal image" style="width:15%;max-width:25%"&gt; <br />
            (2)&lt;div id="eModal" class="modal"&gt; <br />
            (3)&lt;img class="modalContent" id="img1"&gt; <br />
            (4)&lt;/div&gt; 
        </code>
        </div>

        <p>
            <i>(1)</i> is the image you wish to make a modal image. The ID allows it to be referred to in the CSS, which
            is important later. Other than that, it's exactly the same as if you were adding a normal, unclickable image
            to the web page. Note, however, the inline CSS making the image smaller than it actually is, to give people
            a reason to click it. <br />
            <i>(2)</i> is a div with a class and ID that surrounds (3).<br />
            <i>(3)</i> is an image with no source, but a class and an ID. The ID specifies the image as image one (in
            case there are multiple modal images on one page, you could reuse this code and integrate this ID). <br />
            <i>(4)</i> is the closing of the div that is opened in (2).
        </p>

        <h4>CSS</h4>

        <p>
            The CSS for this is entirely based on how the developer wishes it to look; just make sure you're referring
            to the correct thing! The only lines I would specify as important are:
        </p>

        <div class="codebit">
            <code>
            <i>(A)</i> #modalImg:hover {opacity: 0.65;} <br />
            <i>(B)</i> @media only screen and (max-width: 700px){ .modalContent { width: 100%; } } <br />
            <i>(C)</i> modal { display: none; position: fixed; z-index: 1; padding-top: 100px; width: 100%; height: 100%; } <br />
        </code>
        </div>

        <p>
            <i>(A)</i> dims the background once the image is clicked, making the image seem brighter and easier to
            see.<br />
            <i>(B)</i> ensures that on smaller screens the image will still remain fullscreen.<br />
            <i>(C)</i> sets the giant version of the image with the dark background to default to invisible, and only
            appears once the image is clicked upon. Clicking anywhere on the screen will close this and set it to
            invisible. The other declarations ensure the image covers the full browser window, and the image is
            full-sized.
        </p>

        <h4>JavaScript</h4>

        <p>
            The JavaScript is a bit more complicated, and must be done exactly right. Here's the code I used to achieve
            the modal image demonstrated earlier:
        </p>

        <div class="codebit">
            <code>
                var modal = document.getElementById('eModal');<br />
                var img = document.getElementById('modalImg');<br />
                var modalImg = document.getElementById("img1");<br />
                <br />
                img.onclick = function () {<br />
                    modal.style.display = "block";<br />
                    modalImg.src = this.src;<br />
                }<br />
                document.getElementsByClassName("modal")[0].onclick = function () {<br />
                    modal.style.display = "none";<br />
                }
            </code>
        </div>

        <p>
            <code>getElementById</code> uses DOM to access the element by... its ID. The first three lines are
            essentially assigning shorthand variable names to the elements defined in the HTML section, to make it
            easier (and more efficient) to program the Javascript. 'onclick' of the image, the function (the next two
            lines) is called. The function displays the modal, using the image as its own source. The next function
            makes the large version of the image disappear on click of anywhere on the screen.
        </p>

    </div>
