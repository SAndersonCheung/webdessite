            In May 1995, in just 10 days, <i>Brendan Eich</i> created JavaScript, although it was originally named
            ‘Mocha’.
            After two more months, the name was changed to ‘LiveScript’, and then again in December, to “JavaScript”.
            This
            was a big move for Eich (and the company Eich worked at, <i>Netscape</i>), as the name JavaScript required
            receiving a trademark license, due to the creation of Java. Java was very popular at the time, and aided in
            the
            acceptance of JavaScript as an addition to HTML and CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1996, JavaScript was presented to <i>ECMA</i> (European Computer Manufacturers Association), in order to
            receive a standard specification, allowing other browser vendors to implement JavaScript, and allow
            cross-browser compatibility. Over the course of a year, the association considered, and in 1997 the
            <i>ECMAScript</i> (ECMA-262) was released. This official standard covered many implementations, with
            JavaScript
            being the most prominent. Another well-known implementation would be ActionScript 3.
        </p>
        <p>
            ECMA releases standards in cycles, which means that in 1998, ECMAScript 2 was released, and ECMAScript 3 was
            released in 1999. ECMAScript 3 turned out to be a huge success, and is the baseline for current JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2005, Brendan Eich – now working for <i>Mozilla</i> – re-joined the ECMA as a non-profit member, and
            began
            work on ECMA-357. The big corporations kept experimenting with how to implement different types of scripts
            with
            ECMAScript 4, ActionScript 4, and Tamarin.
        </p>
        <p>
            Meanwhile, the community was experimenting with JavaScript. <i>Jesse James Garrett</i> released his idea for
            <i>Ajax</i> – a set of technologies that would be used to create web applications without requiring
            full-page
            reloads, which allows for more dynamic applications. Ajax heavily used JavaScript as the backbone for this.
            After this, a large collection of open-source <i>libraries</i> began, which could be called by JavaScript so
            the
            user would not have to write the code for what, exactly, they wanted. These libraries, such as jQuery,
            Prototype, and Dojo, were a community effort, and grew as more people pre-programmed applications to be
            inputted
            into websites.
        </p>
        <p>
            To this day, these libraries are still used regularly to provide websites with an interactive edge, and the
            many
            JavaScript libraries are still added to as the community think of new ways and new things to do.
