        <h3>How the Web Works</h3>
        <h4>The Web</h4>
        <p class="quote">
            "The Web is an abstract (imaginary) space of information. On the Net, you find computers -- on the Web, you
            find
            document, sounds,
            videos, .... information. On the Net, the connections are cables between computers; on the Web, connections
            are
            hypertext links.
            The Web exists because of programs which communicate between computers on the Net. The Web could not be
            without
            the Net. The Web
            made the net useful because people are really interested in information (not to mention knowledge and
            wisdom!)
            and don't really
            want to have know about computers and cables." <br /> - from <a
                href="https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.html#InternetWeb"><i>What is the difference between the
                    Net and the Web?</i></a>
        </p>


        <p>There are four major components of the web at present:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The academic web: used by researchers and academia</li>
            <li>The commercial web: used for business transactions (eBay and Amazon)</li>
            <li>The social web: used for entertainment (social media)</li>
            <li>The creative web: used for free access to data</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            For the future, the web aims to become more inclusive, by having a low barrier for device connection, which
            will
            however make infrastructure change
            more difficult than at present. The lines between Browser and OS will blur more, as the two become more
            entangled (see Safari on the MacOS and personal
            companions accessing applications). This will all lead to the web becoming more of a service, through the
            concept of <i>Cloud Computing</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
            To understand how the Web works, we must also understand the Internet itself. The Internet is, essentially,
            a
            global-scale network, allowing for sharing of
            resources with every device on the planet capable of connecting to the Internet. In order for this
            communication
            to take place, the Internet uses protocols.
            Protocols act as rules, defining how every piece of communication will take place, such as the type and size
            of
            any data sent between two devices. Users access
            the internet through servers and clients, which can host connection for many users simultaneously.
        </p>

        <h4>Connection Types</h4>

        <p>
            There are two main ways to establish connection via the Internet.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Client/Server</p>
                <p>
                    <i>Client/Server</i> connection is typically two devices working in tandem, where one is the
                    'server',
                    which hosts information, and the other is the 'client', which requests information.
                    The client will initiate connection to the server, while the server will await any requests from
                    clients, as each server will typically have multiple clients.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Peer-to-peer</p>
                <p>
                    <i>P2P</i> technology is a direct connection from one device to another, with each device acting as
                    both
                    a client and a server. This can be much faster than downloading
                    data from a server, however it opens both devices to major security risks.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            In a Client/Server network, all workstations will connect to the unifying force of the server, which will
            then
            deal with any data requests itself. This can be slower than direct
            connection if the server is under strain, but allows for much more security for the network as a whole. P2P
            however, would be a ring of devices connected to one another directly.
            In some cases, the server and the client are the same device. This is a <i>single seat setup</i>.
        </p>

        <h4>Internet Protocols</h4>

        <p>
            In order for the Internet to offer the range of services that it does, it makes use of vast combinations of
            protocols in order to provide very specific services. These services are
            often taken for granted in the modern age - without protocols, we couldn't even send and receive email. A
            list
            of important protocols to know can be found <a
                href="https://www.concise-courses.com/11-protocols/">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The most popular of these protocols is <i>TCP/IP</i>, which stands for <i>Transmission Control Protocol /
                Internet Protocol</i>. TCP/IP is not so much one singular protocol
            alone, but a collection of the most important ones which allow devices to connect to the Internet. You can
            read
            more on TCP/IP protocols <a
                href="https://www.lifewire.com/transmission-control-protocol-and-internet-protocol-816255">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            TCP/IP is actually two protocols that work in tandem to provide connection between devices.
        </p>

        <p>
            The first, the TCP part, is the <i>Transmission Control Protocol</i>. This handles the direct connection
            between
            the client and the server. In order to send data from one workstation to another, the
            data is broken down into individual <i>packets</i> of data. These packets are then split up, and send
            one-by-one
            down the line from one device to another. The TCP breaks the data down into packets,
            and also pieces the packets back together into data for the application.
        </p>

        <p>
            The second part is the IP part, which stands for <i>Internet Protocol</i>. An IP address is a unique
            identifier
            for any device on the Internet: every device has its own special IP. The IP address tells the
            server where the packets are coming from or going to, just like a regular address in the mailing system. The
            IP
            protocol uses this information to send the packets to their correct destination. It does this
            without even requiring a direct connection, as it can use other devices as go-betweens. However, the IP
            protocol
            has its own weaknesses, and packets can easily be delivered out of sequence, or become corrupted
            along the way.
        </p>

        <p>
            The IP protocol works on <i>best effort delivery</i>. This is the idea that the protocol will do its best to
            ensure the packets arrive as intended, but there is no guarantee, and a high chance something will go wrong.
            Common errors include packets arriving late, in incorrect order, corrupted, or getting lost on their route
            and
            requiring a resend. This makes the time taken to send data longer than it should, or even a connection drop
            if the packets are late enough.
        </p>

        <p>
            A packet is actually made up similarly to a HTML document: there is a head, and a body. The head contains
            all of
            the metadata and sequencing, just like in a HTML document, and the body is the actual data
            that is being sent. Without the body, the head has no purpose, and without the head, the body has no
            destination
            or information to help piece it all back together.
        </p>

        <p>
            As IP addresses are long, unique strings of numbers, it can be hard to remember a set IP. To counter this,
            <i>domain names</i> exist. A domain name makes it easier to navigate the Internet by allowing the IP address
            to
            be
            replaced by a text-based name. For example, the page <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/">www.bbc.co.uk</a> will
            have a unique IP, but this is hard to remember. It is much easier to remember the simple terms used in the
            domain name.
            All domain names are stored in a global DNS system, which translates the domain name to the IP address, to
            make
            them interchangeable.
        </p>

        <h4>Web Architecture: HTTP</h4>

        <p>
            <i>HTTP</i> (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the set of protocols in charge of file transfers. These files
            can
            be anything - text, images, sound, etc. Any webpage accessed using the Internet makes use of HTTP. HTTP runs
            alongside
            TCP/IP to function. When clients and servers interact (sending request messages and receiving response
            packets),
            they do so through HTTP messages, which travel as TCP/IP packets. HTTP messages are <i>stateless</i>, which
            means
            each exchange is completely independent: a request/response pair is one pair, and any other information will
            be
            sent as a different exchange.
        </p>

        <p>
            When sending and receiving request/response pairs, the server must tell the client how their request is
            doing.
            It does this by selecting one of the 41 response codes available, and sending that to the client. These
            codes
            inform the
            client of anything, from successs, redirection, and different kinds of errors. Some, you may even know
            yourself:
            404 Not Found is one such Client-side error response code.
        </p>

        <h4>Anatomy of a URL</h4>

        <p>
            A website's <i>URL</i> (Uniform Resource Locator) is a specific location on the site, that is broken down
            into a
            collection of parts. These are detailed below:
        </p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Scheme</th>
                <th>Authority</th>
                <th>Path</th>
                <th>Query</th>
                <th>Fragment</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>http:</td>
                <td>//csvm3000.ncl.ac.uk</td>
                <td>/urls/index.php</td>
                <td>?msg=hello</td>
                <td>#demo</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
            As you can see, the 'scheme' is the protocol HTTP, and the 'authority' is the site's domain name. The 'path'
            directs to a specific page other than the homepage on the website (in this case, the index). The query
            provides
            information
            on what may have been inputted to the site to achieve the page that will load. The fragment details a set
            part
            of the webpage, for example, how low down the scroll bar will be on loading the page.
        </p>
