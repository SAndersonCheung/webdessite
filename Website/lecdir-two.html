        <h2>Web Content Creation (week 2)</h2>
        <h3>Key Principles: Structure, Presentation &amp; Behaviour</h3>

        <h4>The Basics of Web Content: Recap</h4>

        <p>A web page loads via these simple steps: </p>

        <ol>
            <li>The client sends a packet request to the server.</li>
            <li>The server server responds by sending response packets via HTTP.</li>
            <li>The packets are assembled in order to produce the flat file source code.</li>
            <li>The HTML source code is rendered by the browser to show a web page on the client.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Seperation of Concerns</h4>

        <p>The three languages that make up a web page each control a major aspect of the web page. The HTML controls
            the
            content - it's all about structure and subject matter. CSS, meanwhile, controls the presentation and
            appearance
            of the page. JavaScript adds anything extra, controlling the behaviour of the page, and making the site more
            interactive. Look under the 'Languages' tab to find more information on each of these languages.
        </p>

        <div class="note">
            <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> JavaScript controls the interactivity of a site on the client-side; server-side
                uses
                other languages, like PHP or Ruby!
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            By seperating out the page's anatomy like this, it is much easier to maintain and make adjustments. If a
            developer wanted to change the appearance but not the content of the site, they could adjust the CSS without
            having to worry about any content being affected.
        </p>

        <h4>Client-Side Scripting and Server-Side Scripting</h4>

        <p>
            When a website attempts to do anything, it must use a script. The script is a set of instructions for either
            the
            web browser, or the server. Instructions for the web browser are known as client side scripting, whereas
            instructions for the server are known as server-side scripting.
        </p>
        <p>
            Scripting is the way that websites remember their visitors, and their histories. When a search engine
            remembers
            what you last searched for, and recommends results to you, that is an example of scripting usage.
        </p>
        <p>
            Client side scripts are very dependent on the browser that the user is using to access the webpage, and on
            the
            user’s computer. Compatibility issues can arise with the browser, and the computer’s CPU and bandwidth
            (connection strength) correlates to how fast a webpage will load. A slow computer means that the webpage
            will
            load slower, and an incompatible browser means the webpage might not load at all.
        </p>
        <p>
            Server side scripts help individualise how two users will experience the webpage. The two users may have
            very
            different experiences, and this is because of server side scripting. When the request is sent to the server
            that
            the webpage is needed, server side scripting decides how to interpret and adapt the page to suit the user.
            This
            is typically used for websites that have accounts tied to them, as it allows for a level of personalisation,
            and
            privacy. Account-based websites (such as MMORPG’s, and social networking websites) heavily rely on
            server-side
            scripting in order to function.
