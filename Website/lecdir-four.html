        <h2>Web Content: Presentation (weeks 4-5)</h2>
        <h3>CSS Essentials</h3>

        <p>
            CSS stands for <i>Cascading Style Sheets</i>. Please read the base information on CSS available under the
            CSS
            tag, or click <a href="css-html.html">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            To truly understand the extent at which CSS can change a web page, visit <a
                href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/alldesigns/">Zen Garden</a>. It's a website that shows you the
            same
            page, and allows you to adjust the CSS of the web page to see how it can completely change the mood, tone,
            and
            style of a web page without any edits to the content itself.
        </p>

        <p>
            The breakdown of a CSS <i>formatting rule</i> (one unit of declaration) is into two parts: selectors, which
            decide which piece of HTML is affected, and declarations, which decide how that HTML will be altered.
            Multiple
            declarations can be made under one selector.
        </p>

        <div class="codebit">
            <code>
            #one { <br />
            color:grey; <br />
            background-color:blue; <br />
            }
        </code>
        </div>

        <p>
            In the above code, anything marked with the ID 'one' will have a blue background, and white text. We know it
            has
            to be the ID over the 'class' due to the use of '#'. If 'one' was a class instead, it would be preceeded by
            a
            '.' instead of a '#'.
        </p>

        <p>
            <i>Selectors</i> can cover tag, classes, or ID's. One formatting rule can have multiple selectors, to be
            more
            efficient with space and avoid repetitive code. This also allows developers to combine the three for
            specific
            matches, and combine with &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; to give more precise control.
        </p>

        <p>
            <i>Declarations</i> follow a clear-cut structure. First, they state what they are adjusting (ie: color,
            margin,
            border), and then a colon. Then, how they are adjusting it (ie: red, 15px, solid). As multiple delcarations
            can
            exist in the same formatting rule, they must be seperated with a semi-colon.
        </p>

            More selector syntax can be found <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <i>units</i> CSS supports are varied. <i>Absolute</i> units are calculated independently of the rest of
            the
            page, and set at their specific state. They include pixels (px), points (pt), and millimetres (mm).
            <i>Relative</i> units are calculated against either the browser, or other content on the page. They include
            percentages (%), ems (em), and exes (ex). Special relative text units are available (small, large, x-large).
            Combining both can make a design much better.
        </p>

        <p>
            You may have noticed all the colours used in prior examples have been stated by names. This may lead to the
            incorrect impression the CSS has limitations on colour. CSS actually supports three different ways to define
            which colour the developer would like an asset to be. They can state one of the 17 supported colour names,
            they
            can define an RGB code with rgb(0,32,234);, or they can state a hex code with #0000ff;. All of these would
            show
            the colour stated on the web page.
        </p>

        <p>
            <i>Pseudo</i> classes and elements also exist: selectors for special parts or statuses of specific elements.
            Examples include a p:first-letter selector, allowing alteration to the first letter of a paragraph, or the
            a:hover selector, allowing alteration to links whenever they are hovered over.
        </p>

        <h3>CSS Box Model &amp; Positioning</h3>

        <h4>The Box Model</h4>

        <p>
            The box model is a theoretical theory used in HTML and CSS. The idea is that every piece of content on a
            webpage
            is surrounded by a box. There are four key boxes; the content, the padding, the border, and the margin.
        </p>

        <img src="images/boxmodelone.png" alt="Image showing how the box model works: many boxes surrounding an object."
            class="right" />
            <!-- Image using class right (float right) -->

        <p>
            The box model allows the programmer to specify borders and spacing around elements on a web page. The
            content is
            text or an image, and the padding is the invisible space between the content and the border. Similarly, the
            border is a solid line (or dashed, etc.) which surrounds the content, and the margin is the space between
            the
            border, and adjacent elements. When the size of an element is defined in the CSS of a page, it is the
            content
            that is defined. The padding, border, and margin can all be added on to the defined size of the content, in
            order to separate the content from other elements on the page, or in order to define a border.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <i>padding</i> is the space between the outside edge of the content, and the inside edge of its box;
            essentially, the space between the text and the inside of the border.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <i>border</i> is the outline of a box, and has three sub-properties: width, style, and colour. These are
            specified by border-width, border-style, and border-color accordingly. However, you can adjust all of these
            in
            just one declaration:
        </p>

        <div class="codebit">
            <code>
            #one { <br />
            border: 20px solid red <br />
            }
        </code>
        </div>

        <p>
            The <i>margin</i> is the space around the outside edge of the box, including the border. This allows you to
            make
            space between the boxes, and space out your content evenly.
        </p>

        <p>
            The browser will defaultly use the max width available for a box, but this can be adjusted in CSS to ensure
            that
            a box maintains a correct size. To make this more compatible for different sized monitors, modern browsers
            also
            allow for min-width and max-width to be assigned, and decided upon based on the page. The same works for
            height.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <i>background</i> of an asset is the visible space inside any borders, covering the content and padding.
            It
            can be a colour, or an image ( <code> background-image: url(filelocation); </code> ). When an image is used,
            developers can also select the position of the initial image and whether the background repeats, and if so,
            in
            what direction.
        </p>

        <p>
            If the content of a box is greater than the box's absolute set size, <i>overflow</i> is created. There are
            three ways to deal with this: <br />
            <code>overflow:visible;</code> causes the text to flow out of the box, maintaining the same horizontal width
            and extending down lengthwise out of the box. <br />
            <code>overflow:hidden;</code> hides the text that flows out of the box, making the text inside the box
            appear to just end, being cut off but maintaining the overall structure of the webpage. <br />
            <code>overflow:scroll; / overflow:auto;</code> will add a scroll bar with length proportional to the amount
            of text that cannot fit into the box. <br />
        </p>

        <p>
            When utilising text, CSS has two main methods: <i>display</i> and <i>visibility</i>. <br />
            Display alters how the selected text is portrayed. The states <code>block; inline; none;</code> alter how
            the selected text works in regards to surrounding text. For example, 'none' makes it so the selected text is
            invisible, and the space it occupied is filled by whatever follows the selected text, effectively making it
            so the selected text does not exist on the page. The other two mentioned states, 'block' and 'inline' do
            with CSS what is usually done through HTML: change the spacings and flow of a paragraph by utilising a new
            line. 'block' starts the new text on a new line, whereas 'inline' makes the text, well, inline. <br />
            Visibility is, essentially, show/hide. The primary two states are <code>hidden; visible;</code>, which do
            exactly what they say. However, it should be noted that if text is hidden with visibility, the space it
            occupied will not be automatically filled with whatever follows it, as it would if display was set to none.
        </p>

        <h4>CSS Positioning</h4>

        <p>
            The most important thing to do when starting to work on CSS positioning is to ensure that the affected HTML
            is well-structured ordered, and effectively utilises ID's and classes, to allow for the CSS to be equally
            well structured. It is also important to ensure the HTML is consistent, and is using the 'strict' version of
            the selected HTML type.
        </p>

        <p>
            The next step is to ensure you understand how <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp">the
                box model</a> works. Once you envision every component of the website as a box, positioning is simply a
            matter of moving them around.
        </p>

        <p>
            The CSS building blocks to design the structure of a web page are <i>floats</i>, <i>columns</i>, and
            <i>position</i>. Let's go through them one by one.
        </p>

        <img src="images/positioning.png" alt="Example of how an web page's boxes are structured in HTML and then CSS."
            class="center shrink" />
            <!-- Image using classes center (center an image using margin-left/margin-right: auto;) & shrink (shrink the image to 80% size) -->

        <p>
            A <i>float</i> is a property that sends the selected object to the specified direction. These are typically
            'right' and 'left'. Coupled with the 'width' statement, these can be effectively utilised to have two or
            more sections of the web page side-by-side. The selected object is sent as far as possible in the specified
            direction. <br />
            Let's imagine a scenario where a designer floats an image to the left, and there are two different text
            paragraphs positioned after the image in the HTML. Contrary to popular belief, the boxes for the text
            paragraphs won't change size width-wise to appease the image taking up room, but will stretch length-wise to
            wrap their text around the float. <br />
            Accompanying the float statement, is the clear statement, which can be finished with
            <code>right; left; both;</code> to determine which side of the box is cleared of any floated elements, which
            is a term for stopping the float covering content.
        </p>

        <img src="images/columns.png"
            alt="Image showing how utilising padding and margin changes to create columns affects the boxes."
            class="center shrink" />
            <!-- Image using classes center (center an image using margin-left/margin-right: auto;) & shrink (shrink the image to 80% size) -->

        <p>
            When creating two side-by-side columns, typically only one object needs to be floated in a direction.
            Instead of floating one object left, and the other right, you can simply float one left, and adjust padding
            or margin to be the size of the first object. The way this affects to boxes is shown visually in the image
            above.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <i>position</i> propery has four specific values to reposition boxes. They each dictate how the box's
            position interacts with other boxes. <br />
            <code>position: static;</code> is the default value for a box. Due to this, it typically isn't set unless it
            would be otherwise overridden. <br />
            <code>position: relative;</code> has the selected object maintain the flow of the page, but be displayed at
            an offset position, relative to the other boxes. <br />
            <code>position: absolute;</code> has the selected object fully removed from the flow of the page, and can be
            positioned anywhere, independent of other boxes. <br />
            <code>position: fixed;</code> has the selected object fully removed from the flow of the page, and fixes the
            element to the browser's view, meaning it follows the scrollwheel independently of the web page. <br />
        </p>

        <h3>CSS Browsers &amp; Standards</h3>

        <img src="images/boxmodeltwo.png"
            alt="Image showing the differences between standard browser box model and the IE5 bod model."
            class="right" />
            <!-- Image using class right (float right) -->

        <p>
            Making use of the box model allows for a wider level of customisation to any webpage. The designer can even
            alter the distance between the border and the content it surrounds. <br />
            Some browsers are not capable of successfully rendering the box model. Internet Explorer 5 &amp; 6 both have
            issues
            displaying a box accurately, but this can be worked around by adding additional code. Internet Explorer 4
            has
            issues formatting a box correctly, but any workaround attempts will crash the browser. However, these
            browsers
            are not widely used today, and the most common browsers have no problem rendering the box model. The biggest
            issue regarding compatibility is the fact that the Internet Explorer suite comes preinstalled on any Windows
            OS
            PC, but most people today simply use it to download a different browser. <br />
            The incompatibility between Internet Explorer and the rest of the browsers is over what the base definition
            of
            the box should be. When a box is defined, the W3C specification states that this definition should size the
            content alone, whereas in Internet Explorer takes this sizing to include the padding and the border. This
            makes
            a box intended to be quite large significantly smaller, and can lead to layout issues. <br />
            Fortunately, most of these problematic compatibility browsers are outdated, and can be safely ignored, or
            recent versions are much more compatible-friendly.
        </p>

        <p>
            Fortunately, there are resources in place to help developers design around these incompatibilities. <a
                href="https://www.quirksmode.org/css/contents.html">QuirksMode.org</a> is one such tool, detailing which
            browsers are compatible with what elements. It also details how to get around IE6 limitations, utilising
            browser-specific if-statements.
        </p>

        <p>
            As for standards, CSS on the whole is a largely fault- and error-tolerant language. This means it will
            process and compile all complete, valid rules, and ignore any incorrect rules, essentially allowing it to
            always work. To ensure that all of the code writen will be processed, and is valid, <a
                href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">CSS validator services</a> exist.
