        <h2>Web Content: Behaviour (weeks 7-11)</h2>
        <h3>HTML Forms</h3>

        <p>
            A <i>web form</i> is used to allow for user interaction, and collecting user input. Typically, this will
            consist
            of some form of user input data, and a submission button, which sends the input to a specified location.
            Forms
            are much easier than you'd expect, and very useful!
        </p>

        <div class="codebit">
            <code>
        &lt;body&gt; <br />
            &lt;form method="get" action="http://destinationserver.com/"&gt; <br />
            &lt;p&gt; <br />
                Enter your name: &lt;input type="text" name="username" /&gt; <br />
            &lt;/p&gt; <br />
            &lt;/form&gt; <br />
        &lt;/body&gt;
        </code>
        </div>

        <p>
            As you can see from the codebit, the structure of the form is fairly simple. The entirety of the form is
            surrounded by &lt;form&gt;, which specifies the purpose of the form, and the destination of the results of
            the
            form. Then, within the form tags, an input tag will be used, stating its method of collecting data, as well
            as a
            'name' identifier. This is for how the data is sent to the destination, and simply tells the reader of the
            data
            what the data is telling them. For example, if the entered name was 'Joe', the sent data would read
            'username=Joe'. <br />
            Below is an example of what the above code will compile into:
        </p>

        <form method="get" action="http://destinationserver.com/">
            <!-- Just an example input box: no submit button so a functioning destination server isn't necessary -->
            <p>
                Enter your name: <input type="text" name="username" />
            </p>
        </form>


        <p>
            The tag '<code>&lt;input type="text" name="username" /&gt;</code>' is referred to as a <i>form control</i>.
            They
            hold values (explicit, like a typed-in username, or implied, like a selection from a drop down list) which
            are
            specified by their name attribute. Common form controls include text input, radio buttons (a set of buttons
            where only one can be selected), checkboxes (a set of buttons where multiple can be selected), drop-down
            menus,
            and password fields. The form will end with a submission and reset button, which send the data, or clear all
            of
            the fields accordingly. If one form control is left empty, it will simply be skipped over in the sent data.
            Explanations of how to do each of these can be found <a
                href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Due to the nature of forms, they must be organised. As such, there are many form-exclusive tags and
            attributes,
            which offer independent block-level structure, meaning typical tags such as &lt;p&gt; and &lt;div&gt; become
            redundant. For example, &lt;fieldset&gt; works like a &lt;div&gt;, isolating a section of the form, but
            surrounds the section in a visible box. The &lt;legend&gt; tag works in tandem, labelling the isolated
            section.
        </p>

        <p>
            The most important part of the form is the submit button, which sends the data to the destination. Submit
            buttons can be custom images, or browser-drawn regular buttons. Most websites use the latter, as buttons can
            now
            be customised in CSS, and can fit the theme much better, and be interactable. The below code snipped would
            create one such browser button.
        </p>

        <div class="codebit">
            <code>
        &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit this info" /&gt;
        </code>
        </div>

        <img src="images/getvpost.PNG" alt="A table stating the pros and cons of GET in comparison to POST."
            class="center" />
        <!-- Image using class center (center an image using margin-left/margin-right: auto;) -->

        <p>
            Now, let's talk about <i>GET</i> vs <i>POST</i>. You may have noticed in the starting tag for the form, the
            method is specified to 'get'. When the user submits a form with a method set to 'get', the browser makes a
            HTTP
            GET request. If successful, the form data will be appended to the URL as a <i>querystring</i>, which is
            everything after a '?' in the URL. The script that processes this will look at the querystrint ot extract
            and
            use the data. All web requests default to 'get' including typed in addresses in browsers links clicked in
            pages
            and many similar requests.
        </p>

        <p>
            Alternatively, the post method makes a HTML POST request, which is a specific method used for carrying data
            to
            the server in the request's body. This means there is no queryscript attached to any URL. As GET is the
            default
            if a developer wished to use POST they'd have to clearly specify their preference.
        </p>

        <p>
            HTML5 differs here, as its form controls have some features not available in XHTML or HTML4. Essentially,
            there
            are more input types availabe to developers, including sliders, and date-selectors, which allows for much
            better
            data collection on the whole.
        </p>

        <h3>JavaScript &amp; the HTML DOM</h3>

        <p>
            JavaScript is an aptly named scripting language that is embedded into the XHTML of a web page. Using a
            syntax
            similar to that of programming language C's, the language is executed in the client's browser, and does not
            hold
            any relation to the programming language Java. A full timeline of the history of JavaScript can be found <a
                href="timeline-html.html">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            JavaScript is an inline addition to any web page, adding a large catalogue of features and interactions
            otherwise unobtainable, or very difficult to obtain. JavaScript can be used for interaction with mouse
            movement,
            browser-type based behaviours, or validation to forms (which will be investigated in depth below). The tag
            used
            to indicate a piece of JavaScript code is &lt;script&gt;, but must contain an attribute specifying it's type
            as
            interpreter/engine.
        </p>

        <div class="codebit">
            <code>
            &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; <br />
            &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit this info" /&gt; <br />
            &lt;/script&gt;
        </code>
        </div>

        <p>
            An additional attribute for 'src' may also be used in the initialising script tag if the script is external
            in
            nature, and the 'src' will link to the external JavaScript file. When this occurs any code between the two
            scrip
            tags will be ignored, but the script tag can never be self-closing/self-contained. External JavaScript can
            be
            more helpful depending on what the JavaScript's purpose is, as externally stored allows common functions to
            be
            shared, and the code to be reused across multiple pages with little duplication.
        </p>

        <img src="images/javascriptposition.png"
            alt="An image showing how JavaScript should be structured around the head and body: a function exists in the head and is called from the body."
            class="center" />
        <!-- Image using class center (center an image using margin-left/margin-right: auto;) -->

        <p>
            A difficult question when using JavaScript is where in the page to use it. A good rule to follow is to put
            as
            much code as you possible can in the &lt;head&gt; section, so the web page itself is not cluttered. This
            would
            be things like functions and definitions, whereas the actual body of the JavaScript would be where on the
            web
            page the JavaScript is meant to be implemented.
        </p>

        <p>
            JavaScript follows the steps of a standard programming language, with strings numbers and booleans as
            standard
            data types. These can be loosely typed
            (<code>variableOne = 26; variableTwo = true; variableThree = "Hello!";</code>) but it is better practise to
            initialise with the key term <i>var</i> before the name of the variable, and then apply value to the
            variable on
            a different line.
        </p>

        <p>
            Arrays exist in JavaScript with the standard zero-based index (Arrays start at 0). They can be created and
            populated on the same line, or each entry populated independently of creation and can easily be manipulated
            and
            accessed. They are pretty much exactly how they function within Java. <br />
            Loops are also the same to how they function in Java with for loops, if loops, while loops, and do while
            loops
            all being supported.
        </p>

        <p>
            You may have noticed the title for this section, '<i>JavaScript &amp; HTML DOM</i>', and it's time to detail
            what
            HTML DOM is. DOM stands for <i>Document Object Model</i> and is a language/platform neutral interface to a
            document. It defines a document's objects, relationships between the objects, along with their methods and
            proporties. This means it describes HTML documents, the browser window, and allows access to any part of a
            document.
        </p>

        <img src="images/xhtmldom.PNG"
            alt="An image showing how elements are tiered, and how the browser window provides global context for other objects."
            class="right" />
        <!-- Image using class right (float right) -->

        <p>
            The browser window/frame is the 'window' object, from with all objects are decended from in the hierarcy. In
            the
            image shown, you can see a direct descendent is the 'document' object. This object is the current web page
            and
            all HTML elements are components of this.
        </p>

        <p>
            DOM nodes are accessed in a range of methods, which are typically standardised as <i>W3C DOM 1.0</i> but
            browsers generally develop different DOM's, most notable Internet Explorer.<br />
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Access <i>by name</i> is when the objects are referred to by name, in hierarchy order. This has many
                problems, the biggest being that it isnt applicable to all elements of a page, making it an
                inconsistent
                access method. </li>
            <li>Access <i>by built-in object collections</i> is reliant on the browser. The browser will build some
                pre-defined collections for certain DOM objects which can allow for access, removing the need for
                name..
            </li>
            <li><i>Direct</i> access is the usage of a universal address syntax and document methods to access any
                object located in the document via its position, or by type/ID. It does so using a collection called
                'all' to tager the ID of an object. </li>
            <li><i>W3C DOM</i> access is the web standard approach, based on DOM 1.0. Using a range of methods to
                access
                document objects, this access method is supported by all modern browsers. A key perk of this access
                type
                is feature detection, which detects if a feature is supported by the client's browser, and adjusts
                accordingly. This is <i>not</i> a form of reliable browser detection, and should not be used as
                such.
            </li>
            <li><i>Script</i> access is when JavaScript is used to acces the page objects. The components inside the
                document object will all have a type and properties, and potentially, collections and methods. This
                acces method utilises a dot operator ( '.' ) to access objects. </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Form Validation</h3>

        <p>
            Form validation is a good example of how JavaScript can enhance a website. Previously, there may have been
            no
            way to restrict data entered into input other than a restricted data type, but using JavaScript, you can do
            so!
            Take the example below:
        </p>

        <p>Please input a number between 1 and 5:</p>
        <input id="num" />
        <button type="button" onclick="validateNum()">Submit</button>
        <p id="fve"></p>

        <p>
            That takes 16 lines of code, and can be quite useful when the information in the form is vital to not be
            wrong.
            Browsers also have granted an easy way of client-side validating form content, with the 'required' keyword.
            Typing 'required' at the end of the input tag means that the form cannot be submitted with that specific
            input
            box empty. This is commonly used when signing up for things online, and forgetting to enter details such as
            an
            email address.
        </p>

        <div class="codebit">
            <code>
    &lt;form action="/action_page.php" method="post"&gt; <br />
        &lt;input type="text" name="fname" <i>required</i>&gt; <br />
        &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"&gt; <br />
    &lt;/form&gt; 
    </code>
        </div>
