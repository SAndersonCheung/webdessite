        <p>The purpose of this website is to provide an intertactive tutorial site to go alongside the deliverance of
            the
            CSC1024 content for Website design and construction. This module runs for half a year, with two lectures and
            two
            practical sessions a week. The practical sessions will exist to provide a place for students to get direct
            assistance from demonstrators and lecturers with any work they may have in relation to the module.
